## Summary (Intent)

This test case addresses the **export** of the required IFC entities for the exchange of **objects grouping** information. Specifically, this test will verify the ability to create groups, and groups of groups. The test uses railway objects from predecessors tests.

- Refer to [Test Case Imports](#Test-Case-Imports) to know the prerequisites for the present test.

- The [Expected Results](#Expected-Results) section lists the material that will be used to assess the fulfilment of capabilities.

- :zap: This is a test-driven process: refer to the [Validation Criteria](#Validation-Criteria) to understand what is required by the test :zap:




## Itemised Roots

The Test instruction addresses the import and export of the following IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

<details><summary>IFC Entities</summary>

These entities represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_E2a exchange and the overall AbRV MVD. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the MVD**

- Model setup:
   1. IfcSite
   1. IfcRailway
   1. IfcFacilityPart
- Other test-specific entities:
   1. IfcGroup
</details>

<details><summary>Concept Templates</summary> 

These concept templates represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_Ex exchange and the overall AbRV MVD, that must be correctly exported to meet the validation criteria. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the MVD**

- Object Assignment

## Usages, Constraints & Logic 

The following itemised restrictions and constraints shall be placed on IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

<details><summary>Semantic Usages, Constraints & Logic</summary>

The following itemised Usages, Constraints & Logic are normative entries within the AbRV MVD and MUST be satisfied to meet the defined validation criteria

| ID       | CRITERIA                           | COMMENTS                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GROU_101 | Circular reference is not allowed  | Circular reference is not allowed, neither direct (if A includes B, B cannot includes A), nor indirect (if A includes B and B includes C, C cannot includes A) |
| GROU_102 | Only direct inclusion is allowed   | Example: if A includes B and B includes C, A cannot includes C)                                                                                                |
| GROU_103 | Same-level grouping is not allowed | If two or more Group are part of the same Group, they cannot include each others. Example: if A groups B and C, B cannot group C and vice versa)               |
| GROU_104 | Group rooting                      | All Groups that do not have a parent Group must be linked to the IfcProject with an IfcRelDeclares relationship, as per Project Declaration template           |
| GROU_105 | Group typing via ObjectType        | *All group types shall be expressed using the ObjectType (5<sup>th</sup> attribute) of each occurrence of IfcGroup                                             |
| GROU_106 | Allowed entity types for groups    | IfcGroup must be associated (via `IfcRelAssignsToGroup`) only to IfcProduct or IfcGroup (and subtypes)                                                         |

*: this is the only method to express group typing, due to the fact that: i) IfcGroup misses the PredefinedType attribute; and ii) object typing by instantiation of IfcTypeObject is discouraged from IFC4 onward.

### Object grouping

> **Acceptance criteria**: For the **Object grouping** capability, the validation procedure must verify that a group of the requested type is grouping (via `IfcRelAssignsToGroup`) exactly a given number of objects of the requested type, no more and no less.

(See below the table for further specification of each criteria)
| ID       | CRITERIA                                    | VALUE                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| GROU_001 | Mandatory objects are present in the groups | See below the table for further specification |


GROU_001: Mandatory objects are present in the groups
> - Given a set of groups taken from the [Test Case Group Table](#Test-Case-Group-Table)
> - When the Group, and optionally the Group Type, exists
> - Then the Group must group at least a number within [Minimum..Maximum] of the requested Object
>
> NOTE:
> - for typing of groups refer to the Validation criteria of the **Object typing** capability
> - when **Minimum** and **Maximum** have the same value, it means exactly. Example: Minimum=Maximum=2, means that the group must group exactly 2 objects of the requested type.
> - when **Maximum** is empty, it means unlimited. Example: Minimum=1; Maximum=empty, means that the group must group 1 or more elements of the requested type.
    

#### Test Case Group Table

| Group    | Group Type                    | Minimum | Maximum | Object             | Object Type          | COMMENT   | 
|----------|-------------------------------|---------|---------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| IfcGroup | Binari di corsa (Contenitore) | 2       | 2       | IfcFacilityPart    | TRACKSTRUCTURE       | From AL22 |
| IfcGroup | Deviatoi                      | 1       | 1       | IfcElementAssembly | TURNOUTPANEL         | From TP01 |
| IfcGroup | Massicciata                   | 1       |         | IfcCourse          | BALLASTBED           | From SP01 |
| IfcGroup | Traverse                      | 1       |         | IfcGroup           | Segmento di traverse |           |
| IfcGroup | Segmento di traverse          | 1       |         | IfcTrackElement    | SLEEPER              | From SP01 |
| IfcGroup | Rotaie                        | 1       | 1       | IfcGroup           | Segmento di rotaia   |           |
| IfcGroup | Segmento di rotaia            | 2       | 2       | IfcRail            | RAIL                 | From SP01 |

NOTE:
- when **Minimum** and **Maximum** have the same value, it means exactly. Example: Minimum=Maximum=1, means that the group must groups exactly 1 object of that type.
- when **Maximum is empty**, it means **unlimited**. Example: Minimum=1; Maximum=empty, means that the group must group 1 or more object of the requested type.
- the **COMMENT** column indicates (when the object to be grouped is coming from a pre-requisite test) which is the mentioned test.


### Group Spatial Connectivity

> **Acceptance criteria**: For the **Group Spatial Connectivity** capability, the validation procedure must verify that a Spatial Element of the requested type references (via `IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure`) exactly a given number of Groups of the requested type, no more and no less.

| Spatial Element | Spatial Element Type | Minimum | Maximum | Product or Group | Product Type or Group Type    |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------|---------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| IfcRailway      | Località             | 1       | 1       | IfcGroup         | Binari di corsa (Contenitore) |
| IfcFacilityPart | TRACKSTRUCTURE       | 1       | 1       | IfcGroup         | Deviatoi                      |
| IfcFacilityPart | TRACKSTRUCTURE       | 1       | 1       | IfcGroup         | Massicciata                   |
| IfcFacilityPart | TRACKSTRUCTURE       | 1       | 1       | IfcGroup         | Rotaie                        |
| IfcFacilityPart | TRACKSTRUCTURE       | 1       | 1       | IfcGroup         | Traverse                      |

**IMPORTANT**: the track turnout (`IfcElementAssembly.TURNOUT`) should be contained in one spatial structure element only (i.e., `IfcFacilityPart.TRACKSTRUCTURE` named BC01). This should be done in the test **TP01**. The IfcGroup named *Deviatoi* must be referenced to the same spatial structure element. If this is done correctly, a check on the second row of the table above should return an error - as the file will contain two `IfcFacilityPart.TRACKSTRUCTURE`.
