## Summary (Intent)

This test case addresses the **export** of the required IFC entities for the exchange of **track super-structure** information.

This test case focuses only on track super-structure (green in picture below). For the track sub-structure part (red in picture below), refer to test case **IFC4.3AbRV_E2a_SB01**, of which SP01 is an extension.

Snippet:
<img src="./Dataset/TrackCrossSection_snippet.png" width="500"/>

The test also includes the association of some track products (rails, sleepers, ballast, etc.) to: i) the required model breakdown elements (aka, **spatial structure containment**); ii) the required materials (aka, **material association**).

- Refer to [Test Case Imports](#Test-Case-Imports) to know the prerequisites for the present test.

- The [Expected Results](#Expected-Results) section lists the material that will be used to assess the fulfilment of capabilities.

- :zap: This is a test-driven process: refer to the [Validation Criteria](#Validation-Criteria) to understand what is required by the test :zap:





## Itemised Roots
:construction: **under construction, check CT for product shape** :construction:

The Test instruction addresses the import and export of the following IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

<details><summary>IFC Entities</summary>

These entities represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_E2a exchange and the overall AbRV MVD. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the MVD**

- Model setup:
   1. IfcFacilityPart
- Track domain physical products:
   1. IfcRail / IfcRailType
   1. IfcTrackElement
   1. IfcCourse / IfcCourseType
</details>

<details><summary>Concept Templates</summary> 

These concept templates represent a test-specific subset of the wider AbRV_Ex exchange and the overall AbRV MVD, that must be correctly exported to meet the validation criteria. **The scope of the test shall not be used as a definitive scope of the exchange, or of the MVD**

### Object typing

> **Acceptance criteria**: For the **Object typing** capability, the validation procedure must verify that an IFC entity type with the given Name is typing (via `IfcRelDefinesByType`) exactly a given number of objects of the requested Name, no more and no less.
>
> If present, all criteria listed in [Usages, Constraints & Logic](#Usages,-Constraints-&-Logic), and in the same section of precondition tests, shall be verified too.

| Entity Type   | Entity Type Name        | Minimum | Maximum | IfcObject | IfcObject Name              |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| IfcCourseType | Segmento di massicciata | 1       |         | IfcCourse | Segmento di massicciata M01 |
| IfcRailType   | Rotaia 60E1             | 1       |         | IfcRail   | Rotaia BC01 DX              |
| IfcRailType   | Rotaia 60E1             | 1       |         | IfcRail   | Rotaia BC01 SX              |

NOTE:
- when **Minimum** and **Maximum** have the same value, it means exactly. Example: Minimum=Maximum=1, means that the entity type must type exactly 1 object with that Name.
- when **Maximum is empty**, it means **unlimited**. Example: Minimum=1; Maximum=empty, means that the Entity Type must type 1 or more Object of the requested name.

### Spatial decomposition

> **Acceptance criteria**: For the **Spatial decomposition** capability, the validation procedure must verify that a Parent Element of the requested type aggregates (via `IfcRelAggregates`) exactly a given number of Child Elements of the requested type, no more and no less.

| Parent Element | Parent Element Type | Minimum | Maximum | Child Element   | Child Element Type |
|----------------|---------------------|---------|---------|-----------------|--------------------|
| IfcRailway     | Località            | 2       | 2       | IfcFacilityPart | TRACKSTRUCTURE     |

#### Bullet point example:
- IfcRailway *(Name: LO1336)*
  - IfcFacilityPart.TRACKSTRUCTURE *(Name: LO1336-BC-BC01)*
  - IfcFacilityPart.TRACKSTRUCTURE *(Name: LO1336-BC-BC02)*

### Spatial containment

> **Acceptance criteria**: For the **Spatial containment** capability, the validation procedure must verify that a Spatial Element of the requested type contains (via `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure`) exactly a given number of Elements of the requested type, no more and no less.

| Spatial Element | Spatial Element Type | Minimum | Maximum | Element            | Element Type      |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| IfcFacilityPart | TRACKSTRUCTURE       | 1       |         | IfcCourse          | BALLASTBED        |
| IfcFacilityPart | TRACKSTRUCTURE       | 2       |         | IfcRail            | RAIL              |
| IfcFacilityPart | TRACKSTRUCTURE       | 1       |         | IfcTrackElement    | SLEEPER           |

NOTE:
- when **Maximum is empty**, it means **unlimited**. Example: Minimum=1; Maximum=empty, means that the Spatial Element must contain 1 or more elements of the requested type.

|----------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| IfcCourseType  | BALLASTBED  | IfcMaterial         | Gravel        |
